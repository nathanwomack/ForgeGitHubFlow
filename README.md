# ForgeGitHubFlow
Practice Repo for Forge Team's GitHub flow

## Step 1 - Fork the repo
Fork this repo.  You can do that by clicking on the Fork button in the upper right area of this page.  Forking basically makes a copy of this repo in your own space.  It's just a copy though, just a snapshot in time.  So updates to this repo won't automatically show up in the forked repo in your own space.

## Step 2 - Clone your fork
Go to your fork of the repo, which you can find at github.com/<your username>/ForgeGitHubFlow.  There will be a green button there that says "Clone/Download".  When you click on it, it will expand a little area that has a url in a field and a clipboard icon.  Click on the clipboard icon to copy the url to your clipboard.

Now go to your git bash or terminal window.  Use cd to navigate to the directory you want to download the repo into on your computer. Type in ```git clone ``` and paste in the url you just copied to your clipboard, and then hit enter. You may be asked to enter your credentials.  Once you've provided those (if asked) you'll see it downloading the repo.  Once the download has finished, you'll want to change into the repo directory.  You can do that by typing in```cd ForgeGitHubFlow```.
